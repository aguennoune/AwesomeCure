      "['/td>\\\\n  <td><img src=\"https://badge.fury', '.io/py/captest.svg', '/></td>\\\\n</tr>\\\\n\\\\n</table>\\\\n\\\\n# What is pvcaptest?\\\\npvcaptest is an open source python package created to facilitate capacity testing following the ASTM E2848 standard.  The captest module contains a single class, CapData, which provides methods for loading, visualizing, filtering, and regressing capacity testing data.  The module also includes functions that take CapData objects as arguments and provide summary data and capacity test results.\\\\n\\\\nDocumentation and examples are available on [readthedocs](https://pvcaptest.readthedocs', '.io/en/latest/) including full examples in jupyter notebooks that can be run in the browser without installing anything.\\\\n\\\\n# Installation\\\\nThese instructions assume that you are new to using conda and python, if that is not the case skip to the last section for users familiar with conda and pip.\\\\n\\\\nThe recommended method to install pvcaptest is to create a conda environment for pvcaptest. Installing Anaconda or miniconda will install both python and conda.  There is no need to install python separately.\\\\n\\\\n**Easiest Option:**\\\\n1. Download and install the [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda', '.com/products/individual). Follow the default installation settings.\\\\n2. On Windows go to the start menu and open the Anaconda prompt under the newly installed Anaconda program. On OSX or Linux open a terminal window.\\\\n3. Install pvcaptest by typing the command `conda install -c conda-forge pvcaptest` and pressing enter.  The `-c conda-forge` option tells conda to install pvcaptest from the [conda forge channel](https://conda-forge.org', '/#about).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis will install the pvcaptest package in the base environment created when Anaconda is installed.  This should work and provide you with jupyter notebook and jupyer lab to run pvcaptest in. If you think you will use your Anaconda installation to create and maintain additional environments, the following process for creating a stand alone option is likely a better option.\\\\n\\\\n**Better long term option:**\\\\n1. If you do not already have it installed, download and install the [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda', '.com/products/individual) or miniconda.\\\\n2. Go to the [project github page](https://github.com', '/pvcaptest/pvcaptest) and download the project source to obtain a copy of the `environment.yml', '//docs.conda', '.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html']\n",

First create a new development environment using [MacOS instructions](#macos-using-pyenv) or [Linux and Windows instructions](#linux-and-windows-using-conda), but do not install pvtrace using pip! You will need to clone your own copy of the source code in the following steps.\\\\n2. Use the GitHub fork button to make your own fork of the project. This will make it easy to include your changes in pvtrace using a pull request.\\\\n3. Follow the steps below to clone and install the development dependencies\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\n# Pull from your fork\\\\ngit clone https://github.com', '/<your username>/pvtrace.git', 'pvtrace/requirements_dev.txt', 'pvtrace/tests\\\\n\\\\n# Run an example\\\\npython pvtrace/examples/hello_world.py', 'pvtrace/tests` directory if you are adding new code. This will make it much easier to include your changes in the project.\\\\n\\\\n## Pull requests\\\\n\\\\nPull requests will be considered. Please make contact before doing a lot of work, to make sure that the changes will definitely be included in the main project.\\\\n\\\\n# Questions\\\\n\\\\nYou can get in contact with me directly at dan@excitonlabs.com']\n",

      "['//travis-ci.org', '/NREL/SolarPILOT.svg', '//travis-ci.org', \"/NREL/SolarPILOT)\\\\n\\\\nThe SolarPILOT Open Source Project repository contains the source code, tools, and instructions to build a desktop version of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory\\\\'s SolarPILOT. SolarPILOT is a design, characterization, and optimization tool for concentrating solar power (CSP) tower plants. It is available through this repository as a standalone application with full functionality, and it is also included in several CSP tower models within NREL\\\\'s System Advisor Model (SAM) in limited form. For more details about SolarPILOT\\\\'s capabilities, see the SolarPILOT website at [https://www.nrel\", '.gov/csp/solarpilot.html', '//www.nrel', '.gov/csp/solarpilot.html', '//sam.nrel', '//github.com', '/nrel/soltrace) is a general tool for Monte-Carlo ray tracing that allows optical characterization of a wide range of possible systems. The tool is used by SolarPILOT alongside the analytical Hermite polynomial expansion model to ensure model accuracy.\\\\n\\\\n* [SSC](https://github.com', '/mjwagner2/ssc/tree/solarpilot-develop) is a set of \"compute modules\" that simulate different kinds of power systems and financial structures. It can be run directly using the [SAM Software Development Kit](https://sam.nrel', \".gov/sdk). **If you are looking for the algorithms underlying the models, they are located in this repository. For a list of SSC release versions that correspond with SolarPILOT GUI releases, see the release list and tags at [Mike Wagner\\\\'s personal GitHub page](https://github.com\", '/mjwagner2/ssc/releases).**\\\\n\\\\n* [LK](https://github.com', '/nrel/lk) is a scripting language that is integrated into SAM and allows users to add functionality to the program.\\\\n\\\\n* [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets', \".org/) is a cross-platform graphical user interface platform used for SAM\\\\'s user interface, and for the development tools included with SSC (SDKtool) and LK (LKscript). The current version of SAM uses wxWidgets 3.1\", '//github.com', '/nrel/wex) is a set of extensions to wxWidgets for custom user-interface elements used by SAM, and by LKscript and DView, which are integrated into SAM.\\\\n\\\\n* [Google Test](https://github.com', '/google/googletest) is a C++ test framework that enables comprehensive unit-testing of software.  Contributions to the project will eventually be required to have associated unit tests written in this framework.\\\\n\\\\n* This repository, **SolarPILOT**, provides the user interface to assign values to inputs of the computational modules, run the modules in the correct order, and display calculation results. It also includes tools for editing LK scripts, viewing field layout and receiver flux map data, and performing multi-dimensional system optimization.\\\\n\\\\n## Quick Steps for Building SolarPILOT\\\\n\\\\nFor detailed build instructions see the [wiki](https://github.com', '/NREL/SolarPILOT/wiki), with specific instructions for:\\\\n\\\\n* [Windows](https://github.com', '/NREL/SolarPILOT/wiki/build-windows)\\\\n* [Linux](https://github.com', '/NREL/SolarPILOT/wiki/build-linux)\\\\n\\\\nThese are the general quick steps you need to follow to set up your computer for developing SolarPILOT:\\\\n\\\\n1. Set up your development tools:\\\\n\\\\n    * Windows: Visual Studio 2017 Community or other editions available [here](https://www.visualstudio', '.com/).\\\\n    * Linux: g++ compiler available [here](http://www.cprogramming', '.com/g++.html', '//www.wxwidgets', '.org/downloads/) for your operating system.\\\\n\\\\n3. Build wxWidgets.\\\\n\\\\n4. In Windows, create the WXMSW3 environment variable on your computer to point to the wxWidgets installation folder, or Linux, create the dynamic link `/usr/<USERNAME>/local/bin/wx-config-3` to point to `/path/to/wxWidgets/bin/wx-config`.\\\\n\\\\n5. As you did for wxWidgets, for each of the following projects, clone (download) the repository, build the project, and then (Windows only) create an environment variable pointing to the project folder. Build the projects in the following order, and assign the environment variable for each project before you build the next one:\\\\n\\\\n<table>\\\\n<tr><th>Project</th><th>Repository URL</th><th>Windows Environment Variable</th></tr>\\\\n<tr><td>wxWidgets</td><td>https://www.wxwidgets', '.org/downloads</td><td>WXMSW3</td></tr>\\\\n<tr><td>LK</td><td>https://github.com', '/NREL/lk</td><td>LKDIR</td></tr>\\\\n<tr><td>WEX</td><td>https://github.com', '/NREL/wex</td><td>WEXDIR</td></tr>\\\\n<tr><td>Google Test</td><td>https://github.com', '/google/googletest</td><td>GTEST</td></tr>\\\\n<tr><td>SSC</td><td>https://github.com', '/mjwagner2/ssc, -b solarpilot-develop</td><td>SSCDIR</td></tr>\\\\n<tr><td>SolTrace</td><td>https://github.com', '/NREL/SolTrace</td><td>CORETRACEDIR</td></tr>\\\\n<tr><td>SolarPILOT</td><td>https://github.com', '/NREL/SolarPILOT</td><td></td></tr>\\\\n</table>\\\\n\\\\n## Contributing\\\\n\\\\nIf you would like to report an issue with SolarPILOT or make a feature request, please let us know by adding a new issue on the [issues page](https://github.com', '/NREL/SolarPILOT/issues).\\\\n\\\\nIf you would like to submit code to fix an issue or add a feature, you can use GitHub to do so. Please see [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md', '//doi.org', '/10.1016', '/j.solener', '//doi.org', '/10.1016', '/j.solener', '//dspace.library', '.colostate.edu/handle/11124/171000](https://dspace.library', '.colostate.edu/handle/11124/171000).\\\\n\\\\nFor work that builds substantially upon or is derived from the open source project, the preferred citation is:\\\\n\\\\n> Wagner, M.J', 'github.com/NREL/SolarPILOT](https://github.com']\n",

The function returns the irradiance profile along the middle (interior)\\\\nrow by default, but user interface options include `'first'`, `'interior'`,\\\\n`'last'`, and `'single'`. Single-axis tracking is supported, and hourly output\\\\nfiles based on TMY inputs are saved. Spatial nonuniformity is reported, with\\\\nmultiple rear-facing irradiances collected on the back of each module row.\\\\n\\\\nBilinear interpolation code add-on to bifacialvf (description below) to pre-generate IV arrays and bifacial coefficients, and to examine the energy production with back side irradiance mismatch for either a portrait or landscape module.   \\\\nIncluded are IV curves and bifacial info for a Yingli (standard) module. \\\\n\\\\n## Pre-requisites\\\\nThis software is written for Python 2 or 3. NREL recommends [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda\", '.com/download/).\\\\n\\\\n## Install using pip\\\\n[bifacialvf](https://pypi.org', '/project/bifacialvf/) is at the Python Package Index (PyPI). Use pip to install the latest release in your conda environment or virtualenv:\\\\n\\\\n    (myenv)$ pip install bifacialvf\\\\n\\\\n### Install development mode from GitHub\\\\nFor those interested in contributing to bifacialvf:\\\\n\\\\n1.

It contains large solar farms only.\\\\n- Machine Vision dataset - supplied by Descartes labs (Oxford), not publicly available yet.\\\\n\\\\n## Project outcome\\\\n\\\\nThis repo includes a set of scripts that will take\\\\ninput datasets (REPD, OSM, FiT and machine vision \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 each in diff format),\\\\nperform data cleaning/conversion, populate a PostgreSQL database, perform\\\\ngrouping of data where necessary (there are duplicate entries in REPD, multiple solar farm\\\\ncomponents in OSM) and then match entries between the data tables, based on the\\\\nmatching criteria we have come up with.\\\\n\\\\nThe database creation and matching scripts should work with newer versions of the source data files, or at least do so with minimal changes to the data processing (see \"Using this repo\" below).\\\\n\\\\nThe result of matching is a table in the database called `matches` that links the unique identifiers of the\\\\ndata tables. This also contains a column called `match_rule`, which refers to the method by which the match was determined, as documented in [doc/matching](doc/matching.md', '//www.postgresql', '.org/download/)\\\\n2. Install Python 3 (version 3.7', '//osmcode.org', '/osmium-tool/)\\\\n\\\\n### Download and prepare data files\\\\n\\\\n1. Download the following data files from the internet and store locally. We recommend saving these original data files within the directory structure under `data/as_received`:\\\\n    - OSM PBF file (GB extract): [Download](https://download.geofabrik', '.de/europe/great-britain-latest.osm', '//www.ofgem', '.gov.uk/environmental-programmes/fit/contacts-guidance-and-resources/public-reports-and-data-fit/installation-reports) and click the link for the latest Installation Report (during the Turing project, 30 September 2019 was used), then download the main document AND subsidiary documents\\\\n    - REPD CSV file: [Download](https://assets.publishing', '.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/879414/renewable-energy-planning-database-march-2020.csv', 'submodules/compile_osm_solar` and edit the `osmsourcefpath` in `compile_osm_solar.py', 'data/as_received`\\\\n3. Carry out manual edits to the data files, as described in [doc/preprocessing](doc/preprocessing.md', 'data/raw` under the names suggested by the doc, replacing the default dummy data files.\\\\n4. Navigate to `data/processed` and type `make` - this will create versions of the data files ready for import to PostgreSQL\\\\n\\\\n### Run the database creation and data matching\\\\n\\\\n4. Make sure you have PostgreSQL on your machine, then run the command: `createdb hut23-425 \"Solar PV database matching\"` - this creates the empty database.\\\\n5.

      "['//www.nrel', '.gov/csp/soltrace.html', '//sam.nrel', '//github.com', '/nrel/lk) is a scripting language that is integrated into SAM and allows users to add functionality to the program.\\\\n\\\\n* [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets', \".org/) is a cross-platform graphical user interface platform used for SAM\\\\'s user interface, and for the development tools included with SSC (SDKtool) and LK (LKscript). The current version of SAM uses wxWidgets 3.1\", '//github.com', '/nrel/wex) is a set of extensions to wxWidgets for custom user-interface elements used by SAM, and by LKscript and DView, which are integrated into SAM.\\\\n\\\\n* This repository, **SolTrace**, provides the user interface to assign values to inputs of the computational modules, run the modules in the correct order, and display calculation results. It also includes tools for editing LK scripts and viewing ray intersection and flux map data.\\\\n\\\\n## Quick Steps for Building SolTrace\\\\n\\\\nFor detailed build instructions see the [wiki](https://github.com', '/NREL/SolTrace/wiki), with specific instructions for:\\\\n\\\\n* [Windows](https://github.com', '/NREL/SolTrace/wiki/build-windows)\\\\n* [OSX](https://github.com', '/NREL/SolTrace/wiki/build-osx)\\\\n* [Linux](https://github.com', '/NREL/SolTrace/wiki/build-linux)\\\\n\\\\nThese are the general quick steps you need to follow to set up your computer for developing SolTrace:\\\\n\\\\n1. Set up your development tools:\\\\n\\\\n    * Windows: Visual Studio 2019 Community or other editions available at [https://www.visualstudio', '.com/](https://www.visualstudio', '.com/).\\\\n    * Linux: g++ compiler available at [http://www.cprogramming', '.com/g++.html', '//www.cprogramming', '.com/g++.html', '//cmake.org', '/download/](https://cmake.org', '/download/) with the ```Add CMake to the System Path for ...``` option selected.\\\\n\\\\n3. Download the wxWidgets 3.1', '//www.wxwidgets', '.org/downloads/](https://www.wxwidgets', '.org/downloads/).\\\\n\\\\n4. Build wxWidgets.\\\\n\\\\n5. In Windows, create the WXMSW3 environment variable on your computer to point to the wxWidgets installation folder, or Linux, create the dynamic link `/usr/<USERNAME>/local/bin/wx-config-3` to point to `/path/to/wxWidgets/bin/wx-config`.\\\\n\\\\n6. As you did for wxWidgets, for each of the following projects, clone (download) the repository and then (Windows only) create an environment variable pointing to the project folder. \\\\n\\\\n<table>\\\\n<tr><th>Project</th><th>Repository URL</th><th>Windows Environment Variable</th></tr>\\\\n<tr><td>LK</td><td>https://github.com', '/NREL/lk</td><td>LKDIR</td></tr>\\\\n<tr><td>WEX</td><td>https://github.com', '/NREL/wex</td><td>WEXDIR</td></tr>\\\\n</table>\\\\n\\\\n7. Run CMake to create the project build files\\\\n    1. Copy the file ```parent-dir-CMakeLists.txt', 'soltrace/ lk/ wex/``` and ```wxwidgets-3.x', '.x/``` folders.\\\\n    \\\\n    2. Rename this file to ```CMakeLists.txt', '/stdev/CMakeLists.txt', '/stdev/build-soltrace/```\\\\n    \\\\n    4. Open a shell or command window in the build folder from step 3\\\\n\\\\n    5. Copy the following cmake command to the shell and run. Replace the cmake target with a [supported generator](https://cmake.org', '/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7', 'soltrace/ directory.\\\\n    \\\\n    7. Build all files. The output is stored in the soltrace repository folder, e.g', '/stdev/soltrace/app/deploy/soltrace.exe', 'soltrace/``` directory!\\\\n\\\\n## Contributing\\\\n\\\\nIf you would like to report an issue with SolTrace or make a feature request, please let us know by adding a new issue on the [issues page](https://github.com', '/NREL/SolTrace/issues).\\\\n\\\\nIf you would like to submit code to fix an issue or add a feature, you can use GitHub to do so.

It manages charging a 12V AGM lead acid or LiFePO4 battery from common 36-cell 12V solar panels.  It provides 5V power output at up to 2A for systems that include sensors or communication radios.  Optimal charging is provided through a dynamic perturb-and-observe maximum power-point transfer converter (MPPT) and a 3-stage (BULK, ABSORPTION, FLOAT) charging algorithm.  A removable temperature sensor provides temperature compensation.  Operation is plug&play although additional information and configuration may be obtained through a digital interface.\\\\n\\\\n* Optimized for commonly available batteries in the 7-18 Ah range and solar panels in the 10-35 Watt range\\\\n* Reverse Polarity protected solar panel input with press-to-open terminal block\\\\n* Fused battery input with press-to-open terminal block\\\\n* Maximum 2A at 5V output on USB Type A power output jack and solder header\\\\n* Automatic low-battery disconnect and auto-restart on recharged battery\\\\n* Temperature compensation sensor with internal sensor fallback (lead acid batteries)\\\\n* Disable charging when battery is too cold or too hot\\\\n* Status LED indicating charge and power conditions, fault information\\\\n* I2C interface for detailed operation condition readout and configuration parameter access\\\\n* Configurable battery charge parameters\\\\n* Status signals for Night detection and pre-power-down alert\\\\n* Night-only operating mode (switch 5V output on only at night)\\\\n* Watchdog functionality to power-cycle connected device if it crashes or for timed power-off control\\\\n\\\\n### Applications\\\\n* Remote control and sense applications\\\\r* Solar powered web or timelapse camera\\\\r* Night-time \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ccritter cam\"\\\\r* Solar powered LED night lighting controller\\\\n\\\\n#### Bonus Application\\\\nThe charger works well as a 12- and/or 5-V UPS when combined with a laptop power supply.

It can be used to quantify and assign a value framework to CE efforts including re-design, reduction, replacement, reuse, recycling, and lifetime and reliability improvements across the PV value chain. PV ICE enables tradeoff analysis through scenario comparisons, and is highly customizable through user inputs such as deployment schedules, module properties and component materials, and CE pathways.\\\\n\\\\nThe provided PV ICE module and material baselines leverage published data from many sources on PV manufacturing and predicted technological changes. Input data are being compiled [here](https://docs.google\", '.com/spreadsheets/d/1WV54lNAdA2uP6a0g5wMOOE9bu8nbwvnQDgLj3GuGojE/edit?usp=sharing) and the baselines are available here for use in other projects as well as for the PV ICE tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow it Works\\\\n=============\\\\n\\\\nThis section provides a brief description of how the PV ICE tool works. FULL DOCUMENTATION CAN BE FOUND AT [readthedocs](https://pv-ice.readthedocs', '.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMass\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nPV ICE is a dynamic mass flow based tool. It takes in any deployment forecast of any evolving module design along with it\\\\\\'s component materials and uses sophisticated lifetime and reliability parameters to calculate effective capacity, virgin material demand, and life cycle wastes. The calculator captures all the mass flows shown in the simplified diagram below for all years studied in a simulation (ex: 2020-2050). \\\\n\\\\n<img src=\"docs/images_wiki/PV_ICE_diagram-simpleAltUpdate.png', '//docs.google', '.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ec5JRBSN2NFXjEABgUp1ch-EG6uQao8j5Rk1MLuZZYI/edit?usp=sharing). Module baselines capture the annual average crystalline silicon module (i.e', 'fuel/heating energy demands. \\\\n\\\\nWe provide an energy baseline for crystalline silicon modules and component materials. Data for these baselines is being compiled from [literature and report data](https://docs.google', '.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ec5JRBSN2NFXjEABgUp1ch-EG6uQao8j5Rk1MLuZZYI/edit?usp=sharing). For the complete derivation of the energy demands for crystalline silicon modules and materials, please see the Jupyter Journals (tutorials \\\\\\\\ baseline development documentation) and (baselines \\\\\\\\ SupportingMaterials). Alternate module and material files can be created by the user, and an expanded set of PV technology baselines is planned for the future, including CdTe and perovskites.\\\\n\\\\nAfter running a mass flow simulation, an energy flow calculation can be run which will multiply the energy demands by the mass flows and calculate annual generation from the deployed modules. Results of this calculation provide annual, cumulative, and lifetime energy demands and energy generated. These values can be used to calculate energy balance metrics such as energy return on investment (EROI), net energy, and energy payback time (EPBT). These features are actively under development, so check back for updates soon!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInstallation for PV ICE\\\\n=======================\\\\n\\\\nPV ICE releases may be installed using the ``pip`` and ``conda`` tools.\\\\nPlease see the [Installation page](http://PV_ICE.readthedocs', '.io/en/latest/installation.html', '//github.com', '/NREL/PV_ICE/blob/development/docs/tutorials/0%20-%20quickStart%20Example.ipynb', '//github.com', '/NREL/PV_ICE/blob/development/docs/tutorials/1%20-%20Beginner%20Example.ipynb', 'Featuring/Leveraging PV ICE\\\\n==========================================\\\\n\\\\nPV ICE has been used in a variety of published analyses, including:\\\\n\\\\n**High Impact Report: The Solar Futures Report and Circular Economy Technical Report**\\\\n\\\\n    Ardani, Kristen, Paul Denholm, Trieu Mai, Robert Margolis, \\\\n    Eric O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Shaughnessy, Timothy Silverman, and Jarett Zuboy. 2021. \\\\n    \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSolar Futures Study.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d EERE DOE. \\\\n    https://www.energy', '.gov/eere/solar/solar-futures-study.\\\\n\\\\n    Heath, Garvin, Dwarakanath Ravikumar, Silvana Ovaitt, \\\\n    Leroy Walston, Taylor Curtis, Dev Millstein, Heather Mirletz, \\\\n    Heidi Hartman, and James McCall. 2022. \\\\n    \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEnvironmental and Circular Economy Implications of Solar Energy\\\\n     in a Decarbonized U.S', 'NREL/TP-6A20-80818.

Enabling thousands of people to help solve ML problems which, if solved, might help reduce CO2 emissions\\\\n2. Running small(ish) pilot projects to implement the best solution in industry\\\\n3. Enabling thousands of practitioners to use the code in their products.\\\\n\\\\n# What\\\\\\'s the likely climate impact?\\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\\\'s really, really, _really_ hard to estimate climate impact of forecasting!

      "['//www.nature', '.com/articles/s41586-021-03957-7). \\\\n\\\\n# Project Summary\\\\n\\\\n## Abstract\\\\n\\\\nPhotovoltaic (PV) solar energy generating capacity has grown by 41\\\\\\\\% per year since 2009. This rapid deployment of solar energy must continue if climate and Sustainable Development Goals are to be met. Energy system projections that mitigate climate change and facilitate universal energy access  show a nearly ten-fold increase in PV solar energy generating capacity by 2040. Geospatial data describing the energy system is required to manage generation intermittency, mitigate climate change risks, and identify trade-offs with biodiversity, conservation, and land protection priorities caused by the land use and land cover change necessary for PV deployment. Currently available inventories of solar generating capacity cannot fully address these needs. Here, we provide a global inventory of commercial-, industrial-, and utility-scale PV solar energy generation stations (i.e', 'SPOT6/7 remote sensing imagery. Here, we show out-of-training-sample examples showing SPOT6/7 and Sentinel-2 optical imagery, primary inference from U-Net<sup>[2](https://arxiv.org', '/abs/1505.04597', '/sup> computer vision models, and vectorised polygon outputs. Our models are robust to a variety of geometries and orientations, land covers, seasons, and atmospheric conditions.\\\\n\\\\n![alt text](makefigs/figures/fig-1_samples.png', \"/sup>, approximately half of the Earth\\\\'s land surface area, based on population density. Additional machine learning models were used to filter the dataset for false positives. The remaining detections were verified by hand to ensure a high-quality dataset. Installation date for each solar PV facility was inferred heuristically from the detection timeseries. \\\\n\\\\n![alt text](makefigs/figures/fig-A1_pipeline.png\", 'makefigs/figures/fig-2_global.png', 'makefigs/figures/fig-3_land_cover_global.png', 'makefigs/figures/fig-A10_land_cover_regional.png', '//zenodo.org', '/record/5005868).\\\\n\\\\nAn interactive visualisation of our dataset is from the World Resources Institute [here](https://resourcewatch.org', '/data/explore/ene032-Solar-Plants_1).\\\\n\\\\n## Acknowledgements\\\\n\\\\nThe authors acknowledge the generous contribution of [Descartes Labs, Inc.](https://www.descarteslabs', '.com/) which provided the authors with API credentials for easy imagery access and manipulation, and a cloud computation platform for imagery analysis. Descartes Labs is spin-out company from Los Alamos National Laboratory that provides a data refinery for satellite imagery. The authors also acknowledge the generous support of the [World Resource Institute](https://www.wri', '.org/) who provided insight and data resources to the project. [Wiki-Solar](https://wiki-solar.org', '/) also provided valuable insight and data. The Sentinel-2 semantic segmentation model was trained on Amazon Web Services with a supporting grant. The hand-verification of Sentinel-2 detections was supported by Microsoft Azure cloud computing services with credits provided by the AIforEarth program.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n# Repository\\\\n\\\\n## Setup\\\\n\\\\n### Virtual Environment\\\\n\\\\nWe recommend using Conda for package and environment management. Create a new conda environment:\\\\n\\\\n    conda create -n solar-pv python=3.6', '//path/to/conda/envs/solar-pv/etc/conda/activate.d', '/env_vars.sh', '//path/to/conda/envs/solar-pv/etc/conda/activate.d', '/env_vars.sh', 'SPOT6/7 access is required to run this repository.\\\\n\\\\n### Gurobi\\\\n\\\\nMatching installations to existing data uses a mixed integer linear program specified using [PuLP](https://pypi.org', '/project/PuLP/). We use [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi', '.com/), a commercial solver, to solve the linear program. Gurobi requires a [license](https://www.gurobi', '.com/documentation/9.0', '/quickstart_mac/retrieving_and_setting_up_.html', '//conda.anaconda', '.org/gurobi\\\\n    conda install gurobi\\\\n\\\\n## Directories and Scripts\\\\n- **solarpv\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\**\\\\n  - **training\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\**\\\\n    - **s2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\**\\\\n      - `model_resunet.json', 'reading/writing by cloud functions\\\\n      - `pipeline.py', '//zenodo.org', '/record/5005868).

Sentinel-2 training samples can be generated using the multithreaded generator: \\\\n```python\\\\npython solarpv/training/s2/training_data_mp.py', 'solarpv/training/s2/train_S2_unet.py', 'solarpv/training/s2/train_S2_RNN1.py', 'solarpv/training/s2/train_S2_RNN2.py', 'SPOT6/7 imagery and so must be retained on an infrastructure licensed for SPOT6/7 imagery. Training the SPOT branch requires access to the DescartesLabs platform. Contact the authors for details.\\\\n2. Obtain the UNet training imagery and move these images into `data/SPOT_train/ground/` and obtain or develop `train_keys.txt', 'solarpv/training/spot/train.py', 'solarpv/training/spot/train.py', 'data/SPOT_train/classifier_ground/` and sort them into `train` and `val`, and `neg` and `pos` within each.\\\\n5.

If you wish to continue using version 1.0', '//data.nrel', '.gov/submissions/169).\\\\n\\\\n## Get Your Tools\\\\nInstall Docker for [(Mac)](https://docs.docker', '.com/docker-for-mac/install/) or [(Windows)](https://docs.docker', \".com/docker-for-windows/install/)\\\\n\\\\n- Important: In Docker, go into Docker > Preferences > Resources and up the allocation for disk size image for Docker. 16 GB is recommended for smaller (state level) databasese. 32 GB is recommended for ISO specific databases. 70+GB is required for restoring the national level database. If you get a memory issue then you\\\\'ll need to up the memory allocation and or will need to prune past failed images/volumes. Running the below docker commands will clear these out and let you start fresh:\\\\n```\\\\n   $ docker system prune -a \\\\n   $ docker volume prune -f\\\\n``` \\\\n- Please refer to Docker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s [documentation](https://docs.docker\", '.com/reference/) for more details.\\\\n\\\\n- Install [Anaconda for Python 3.7', '//www.anaconda', '.com/distribution/). Users with VPNs may need to turn their VPNs off while installing or updating Anaconda.\\\\n\\\\n- Install [PgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin', \".org/download/). Ignore all of the options for docker, python, os host, etc.\\\\n\\\\n- Install Git: If you don\\\\'t already have git installed, then navigate [here](https://www.atlassian\", \".com/git/tutorials/install-git) to install it for your operating system.\\\\n\\\\nWindows users: \\\\n- We recommend using Powershell.\\\\n- If you don\\\\'t have UNIX commands enabled for command prompt/powershell then you\\\\'ll need to install Cygwin or QEMU to run a UNIX terminal.\\\\n\\\\n## Download Code \\\\nUsers need to fork a copy of the dGen repo to their own private github account. \\\\n\\\\nNext, clone the forked repository to your local machine by running the following in a terminal/powershell/command prompt:\\\\n```$ git clone https://github.com\", '/<github_username>/dgen.git', '/../dgen/python) and run the following command:\\\\n\\\\n```$ conda env create -f dg3n.yml', \"mdillon/postgis```\\\\n\\\\n- Alternatively, if having issues connecting to the postgres server in pgAdmin, run:\\\\n\\\\n```$ docker run --name postgis_1 -p 5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d mdillon/postgis```\\\\n\\\\n- This will allow the docker container to select a different port to forward to 5432.\\\\n\\\\nTo setup another docker container with a different database you can run:\\\\n```$ docker run --name postgis_2 -p 7000:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d mdillon/postgis``` where ```7000``` can be any port number not already in use. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3. Connect to our postgresql DB. In the command line run the following:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n   $ docker exec -it <container id> psql -U postgres\\\\n   $ postgres=# CREATE DATABASE dgen_db;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nNotes:\\\\n- Use the alpha-numeric container id rather than the container name.\\\\n- The container id can be gotten by running ```$ docker container ls```. If this doesn\\\\'t display anything try running ```$ docker container ps```.\\\\n- If you get the error ``` psql: FATAL:  the database system is starting up ``` try rerunning the docker exec command again after a minute or so because docker can take some time to initialize everything.\\\\n- ```CREATE DATABASE``` will be printed when the database is created. ```\\\\\\\\l``` will display the databases in your server.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n### B. Download data (agents and database):\\\\nDownload data by navigating to https://data.openei\", \".org/submissions/1931 and clicking the \\\\'model inputs\\\\' tab. Make sure to unzip any zipped files once downloaded. Note, the 13.5\", \"prompt/powershell then you\\\\'ll need to install Cygwin or QEMU to run a UNIX terminal.\\\\n\\\\nIn Powershell run the following (replace \\\\'path_to_where_you_saved_database_file\\\\' below with the actual path where you saved your database file):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n   $ docker cp /path_to_where_you_saved_data/dgen_db.sql\", '/dgen_db.sql', '/path_to_where_you_saved_data/dgen_db.sql', 'state/ISO databases will likely take 5-15 minutes. The national database will likely take 45-60 minutes.\\\\n- Don\\\\\\'t close docker at any point while running dGen.\\\\n- The container can be \"paused\" by running ```$ docker stop <container id>``` and \"started\" by running ```$ docker start <container id>```\\\\n- The container must be started/running to restore and or access the database (including during model run time).\\\\n\\\\nTroublshooting Container/Database Issues:\\\\n- Make sure the disk size for Docker has been properly allocated (make sure at least 16GB has been allocated for state level databases, at least 32 GB for ISO level databases, and at least 70 GB for the national database). You\\\\\\'ll need to restart docker after changing the disk size in Docker\\\\\\'s system preferences and will need to make a new container/start from scratch.\\\\n- If making a new container first run ```docker system prune -a``` and ```docker volume prune -f```.\\\\n- Make sure you\\\\\\'ve specificed the right path to the .sql', 'host/address cell and \"postgres\" in both the username and password cells. Upon refreshing this and opening the database dropdown, you should be able to see your database. \\\\n\\\\n### D: Activate Environment \\\\nActivate the dg3n environment and launch spyder by opening a new terminal window and run the following command:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n   $ conda activate dg3n\\\\n   $ (dg3n) spyder\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n- In spyder, open the ```dgen_model.py', \"/path_to_where_you_cloned_dgen/dgen_os```.\\\\n- Spyder\\\\'s kernel can sometimes have issues/stop unexpectedly. Refreshing the kernel might help if you\\\\'re encountering issues running dgen_model.py\", 'os/excel/input_sheet_v_beta.xlsm', 'os/input_scenarios/my_scenario.xlsm', '//github.com', '/NREL/dgen/wiki) for more details on customizing scenarios. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n2. In the python folder, open ```pg_params_connect.json', '/../dgen/python/config.py', '/../dgen/python/config.py', '/../dgen/python/config.py', '/../dgen/python/config.py', '/../path_to_save_directory/dgen_db.sql', 'Import/Export\" option and configure how you want the data to be saved. Note, if a save directory isn\\\\\\'t specified this will likely save in the home directory.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Notes:\\\\n- The \"load_path\" variable in config.py']\n",

The most important files here\\\\n   are `analysis/control/crosswind.py', 'analysis/control/generate_hover_controllers.m', './lib/scripts/install/install_packages.sh', '/.bashrc', './docker_build.sh', './docker_run.sh', '///localhost:8000` on your browser.\\\\n\\\\nFor a full list of available flags when running the simulator, see the file\\\\n`sim/run_sim.py', \"lib/scripts/operator` and\\\\n`lib/scripts/developer`.\\\\n\\\\n## How to read the logs\\\\n\\\\nThe Control Telemetry Users' guide, included as a PDF with this distribution, gives a full\\\\ndescription of log file data structures. Below are examples for how to load and plot log data\\\\nusing Python or MATLAB.\\\\n\\\\n### Python\\\\nHere's a small example showing how to load an h5 log file in Python and plot a variable (in this case, the kite's altitude). Accessing the log files is made much less painful by enabling tab-completion of telemetry fields; instructions are in `lib/python/ipython_completer.py\", 'bin/lib/bazel/pyembed ipython`, you will be able to access some Makani library functions (like `DcmToAngle`) directly from Python.\\\\n\\\\nYou can also explore the field names using `.items', \"messages/kAioNodeBattA/kMessageTypeSlowStatus'].len\", \"messages/kAioNodeBattA/kMessageTypeSlowStatus'][0]\\\\n\\\\n# The nested field names:\\\\nlog['messages/kAioNodeBattA/kMessageTypeSlowStatus'][0].dtype\", \"/messages/kAioNodeControllerA/kMessageTypeControlTelemetry');\\\\ntime = c.message\", \"HOME/analysis\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nRun the following script in the MATLAB console to set all relevant paths:\\\\n\\\\n```matlab\\\\nSetMatlab\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nNow you can run the following code on console to access telemetry data:\\\\n\\\\n```matlab\\\\nlog = h5load('20161121-142912-flight01_crosswind.h5\", \"/messages/kAioNodeControllerA/kMessageTypeControlTelemetry');\\\\nTime = c.message\", \"HOME/analysis\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nRun the following script in the MATLAB console to set all relevant paths:\\\\n\\\\n```matlab\\\\nSetMatlab\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nNow open the H5Plotter (a GUI interface for opening and plotting H5 log data) by running the following in the MATLAB console:\\\\n\\\\n```matlab\\\\nH5Plotter\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nLoad a H5 log file using the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Choose\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 button in the top right corner. Once the file is loaded, datasets appear in \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98AIO Nodes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 panel box. Click on one or more of these nodes to access the corresponding datasets in the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98AIO Messages\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 panel box. Only datasets common to all selected AIO nodes are shown.\\\\n\\\\nOnce you have selected data to plot in the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98AIO Messages\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 panel box, use the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98plot\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 button at the bottom right corner to visualize the data. Holding ctrl or shift allows multiple fields to be selected and selecting a node in the tree will plot all data contained beneath that node. Data can also be exported by right clicking.\\\\n\\\\nNOTE: You can plot multiple datasets simultaneously on the same time axes. How many datasets you can plot at the same time is only limited by your machine\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s RAM; be judicious about this.\\\\n\\\\n#### Matlab Example: Plot roll, pitch, and yaw\\\\n\\\\nHere's a small example that converts the `dcm_g2b` matrix into Euler angles.\\\\n\\\\n```matlab\\\\n% Read the log file.\\\\nfilename = '20161121-142912-flight01_crosswind.h5\", \"/messages/kAioNodeControllerA/kMessageTypeControlTelemetry');\\\\n\\\\n% Fetch the dcm_g2b matrix \\\\ndcm_g2b = c.message\", \"180/pi, '.', ...\\\\n     c.message\", \"180/pi, '.',...\\\\n     c.message\"]\n",

It was originally part of the \\\\n`feedinlib <https://github.com', '/oemof/feedinlib>`_ (windpower and photovoltaic) but was taken out to build up a community concentrating on wind power models.\\\\n\\\\nFor a quick start see the `Examples and basic usage <http://windpowerlib.readthedocs', '.io/en/stable/getting_started.html', '//windpowerlib.readthedocs', '.io/en/stable/>`_.\\\\n\\\\nUse the `project site <http://readthedocs.org', '/projects/windpowerlib>`_ of readthedocs to choose the version of the documentation. \\\\nGo to the `download page <http://readthedocs.org', '/projects/windpowerlib/downloads/>`_ to download different versions and formats (pdf, html, epub) of the documentation.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInstallation\\\\n============\\\\n\\\\nIf you have a working Python 3 (>= 3.6', '//oemof.readthedocs', '.io/en/stable/installation_and_setup.html', '//windpowerlib.readthedocs', '.io/en/stable/getting_started.html', '//matplotlib.org', '/users/installing.html', '//mybinder.org', '/v2/gh/wind-python/windpowerlib/dev?filepath=example>`_ and open them with Binder.\\\\n\\\\nThe basic usage of the windpowerlib is shown in the `ModelChain example <http://windpowerlib.readthedocs', '.io/en/stable/modelchain_example_notebook.html', '//raw.githubusercontent', '.com/wind-python/windpowerlib/master/example/modelchain_example.py', '//raw.githubusercontent', '.com/wind-python/windpowerlib/master/example/modelchain_example.ipynb', '//raw.githubusercontent', '.com/wind-python/windpowerlib/master/example/weather.csv', '//jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs', '.io/en/latest/install.html', '//jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs', '.io/en/latest/execute.html', '//windpowerlib.readthedocs', '.io/en/stable/turbine_cluster_modelchain_example_notebook.html', '//raw.githubusercontent', '.com/wind-python/windpowerlib/master/example/turbine_cluster_modelchain_example.py', '//raw.githubusercontent', '.com/wind-python/windpowerlib/master/example/turbine_cluster_modelchain_example.ipynb', '//windpowerlib.readthedocs', '.io/en/stable/examples.html', '//github.com', '/wind-python/windpowerlib/tree/master/windpowerlib/oedb>`_\\\\n(power curves, hub heights, etc.) for a large set of wind turbines. See `Initialize wind turbine` in `Examples section <http://windpowerlib.readthedocs', '.io/en/stable/examples.html', '//openenergy-platform.org', '/dataedit/>`_ (oedb).\\\\nTo update your local files with the latest version of the `oedb turbine library <https://openenergy-platform.org', '/dataedit/view/supply/wind_turbine_library>`_ you can execute the following in your python console:\\\\n\\\\n.. code:: python\\\\n\\\\n  from windpowerlib.data', '126/4200\",  # turbine type as in register\\\\n        \"hub_height\": 135,  # in m\\\\n    }\\\\n    e126 = WindTurbine(**enercon_e126)\\\\n\\\\nWe would like to encourage anyone to contribute to the turbine library by adding turbine data or reporting errors in the data.\\\\nSee `the OEP <https://github.com', '/OpenEnergyPlatform/data-preprocessing/issues/28>`_ for more information on how to contribute.\\\\n\\\\nUse your own turbine data\\\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\\\n\\\\nIt is possible to use your own power curve. However, the most sustainable way\\\\nis to send us the data to be included in the windpowerlib and to be available\\\\nfor all users. This may not be possible in all cases.\\\\n\\\\nAssuming the data files looks like this:\\\\n\\\\n.. code::\\\\n\\\\n    wind,power\\\\n    0.0', 'path/to/my/data/file.csv', '//github.com', '/wind-python/windpowerlib and install the cloned repository using pip:\\\\n\\\\n.. code:: bash\\\\n\\\\n  pip install -e /path/to/the/repository\\\\n\\\\nAs the windpowerlib started with contributors from the `oemof developer group <https://github.com', '/orgs/oemof/teams/oemof-developer-group>`_ we use the same\\\\n`developer rules <http://oemof.readthedocs', '.io/en/stable/developing_oemof.html', '//help.github', '.com/articles/fork-a-repo>`_ the windpowerlib repository to your own github account.\\\\n* Change, add or remove code.\\\\n* Commit your changes.\\\\n* Create a `pull request <https://guides.github', '.com/activities/hello-world/>`_ and describe what you will do and why.\\\\n* Wait for approval.\\\\n\\\\n**Generally the following steps are required when changing, adding or removing code:**\\\\n\\\\n* Add new tests if you have written new functions/classes.\\\\n* Add/change the documentation (new feature, API changes ...).\\\\n* Add a whatsnew entry and your name to Contributors.\\\\n* Check if all tests still work by simply executing pytest in your windpowerlib directory:\\\\n\\\\n.. role:: bash(code)\\\\n   :language: bash\\\\n\\\\n.. code:: bash\\\\n\\\\n    pytest\\\\n\\\\nCiting the windpowerlib\\\\n========================\\\\n\\\\nWe use the zenodo project to get a DOI for each version. `Search zenodo for the right citation of your windpowerlib version <https://zenodo.org']\n",
